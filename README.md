# Software Bug Tracker & Ticketing System

The Bug Tracker project was our second ASP.NET MVC project and the biggest by far.  This project was an indoctrination into C# and OOP; where the rubber meets the road.  The same disclaimer located on my personal portfolio repo applies here.  The code is not representative of clean code standards or basic SOLID principles.  The objective was to learn and get it done by the deadline.  Code base can use a lot of love.

## Application Highlights:  
* Ability to report software bugs, open and submit tickets for tracking purposes
* Ability to upload ticket attachments for approved file types and add ticket comments  
* Application contains role-based authentication and functionality  
* Developers receive email notifications when a ticket is created or edited  
* Security to prevent cross-site scripting  
* Designed and implemented SQL database using Entity Framework Code First  
* Utilized LINQ for database queries  

## Technologies/Frameworks  
ASP.NET, MVC, C#, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and integrated Bootstrap template.
